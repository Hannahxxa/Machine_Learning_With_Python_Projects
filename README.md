This repository includes all the Machine Learning projects that I've worked on in python.

### **1. Bitterness Prediction Using Machine Learning**

This project explores predicting the bitterness of drug compounds using molecular descriptors and machine learning. The study leverages datasets from BitterDB and e-tongue experiments, including synthetic data generation, to analyze the molecular attributes influencing bitterness perception.

#### **Key Highlights**:
- **Predictive Models**: Linear Regression, XGBoost, Gaussian Process Regression.
- **Data Sources**: BitterDB dataset, e-tongue real data, and synthetic datasets.
- **Feature Selection**: Random Forest, SelectKBest, and SHAP were used to identify key molecular descriptors such as:
  - **BCUT2D_LOGPHI** (lipophilicity).
  - **SMR_VSA** (molar refractivity).

This project emphasizes the power of machine learning in pharmaceutical research and demonstrates techniques for handling small datasets using synthetic data augmentation.
